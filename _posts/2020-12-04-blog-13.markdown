This is the final blog for the Fall semester. For one of the last projects I am working with Google Maps to make a
kind of quiz game where you double click where a stated location is and it lights up green if correct or lights
up another location in red where the location really is. In this particular case, this code will create a map that's
centered on CSUN.

{% highlight javascript %}
let map;

function initMap() {
  map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("map"), {
    center: { lat: 34.2383, lng: -118.5237 },
    zoom: 8,
  });
}
{% endhighlight %}

It has been one hell of a semester with everything online, but hopefully everyone will figure things out and
get to graduating on time. In the meantime, I'll be thinking on what to do for next semester's group project.
