Our first presentation was this week Thursday. I think it went over well, but we need an actual diagram that presents
our infrastructure properly. We'll need to display seperate networks, load balancers, and proper CIDR labeling if possible.
I think this will be a single server setup though, so it shouldn't be very complicated.

I wish I had more to write about, but other than the preliminary stuff, there's been nothing important to report about.
Maybe when we actually get the diagram and some code going, I'll have more to talk about.
