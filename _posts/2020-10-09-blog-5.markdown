This week we'll go over a little more on CSS and how it interfaces with CSS. I learned about a new fix to the HTML box model.
The fix sets the box-sizing to border-box, which is added to the HTML selector, then asterisk selectors target every single HTML
element, which ensures all elements inherit the border-box style from the first declaration. The purpose of this fix is to 
make the padding and border push inward, making a given element remain the same size, with the content shrinking instead.

Another interesting aspect we learned about was padding in both long and shorthand. For shorthand, which is much more simple,
syntax for one value dictates that that specific value is applied to all sides. Two values have the first value apply to the top
and bottom of the element, while the second applies to the right and left. Three values have the first value apply to the top, 
the second applies to the right and left, and the third applies to the bottom of the element. Four values apply in a clockwise pattern
around the element, starting with the top.

Next time we'll be presenting a prototype resume website for homework, so I may report on how that went.
