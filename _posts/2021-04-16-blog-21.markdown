So recently we found how to automate deployment of docker containers for our rocketchat app.
All we'll need is the docker-compose yml file that we'll boot up with the docker-compose command.
What should happen is a MongoDB service should start, rocketchat service should start when mongo is ready, and
a hubot service should also start as well.
We'll have the yml file up on the repo once we finish making it.
