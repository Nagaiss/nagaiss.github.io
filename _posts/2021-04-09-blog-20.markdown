So a basic terraform config must be hosted in its own working directory. What my config is going to look like is pretty much
three blocks of code. Those blocks are the terraform block with the terraform settings, the provider block with config
for a specific provider listed in the terraform block, and the resource block which defines components of infrastructure that
could be physical/virtual like a server instance or logical like an app.

One last thing, when config is applied, terraform writes data into a state file where it tracks what resources it needs to
manage. This file is very sensitive and needs to be protected from manipulation.
