Not too much to share this week. There was a bit of an issue with Amazon thinking that my account was compromised
so I switched the passwords up. I suppose that's one thing to share about. Password security is very important, and
you'd probably be well off switching them up every so often. For the very last blog I'll have most of the terraform
script listed as an example of a script.
