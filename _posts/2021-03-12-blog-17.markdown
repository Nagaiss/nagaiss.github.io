We still haven't done very much regarding our project, but I figured I'd list one of the pitfalls I've had regarding
AWS free tier payments. They only support like one micro server type, and if you use anything else and just leave it running
you'll find yourself being charged hundreds of dollars in a short amount of time. So be sure to shut down or terminate instances
once you're finished using them.

Also, if you're deploying S3 buckets, be careful with those too since using too much storage will also cause charges towards your
account as well.
