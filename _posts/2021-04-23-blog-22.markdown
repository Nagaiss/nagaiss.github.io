The terraform script worked as intended. Using variable data, it can start as many EC2 instances
as it needs to with powershell commands. The next and probably final step is to have all EC2 instances start with
Ansible installed on initialization. This will be slightly more complex as I believe Ansible requires Ubuntu with a
version past 18. 

Our project is nearing completion and all that will remain is all the pieces coming together to make a working application.
