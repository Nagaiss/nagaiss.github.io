Just a little more to go. For this blog I wanted to go over a small bit of terraform code.

{% highlight terraform %}
resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  count         = var.instance_count
  ami           = "ami-830c94e3"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
{% endhighlight %}

The count data field listed above has a var identifier attached to a custom variable that I set up on a variable tf file
in the same directory. Also not listed is a user_data field that will be used to boot up ansible on initialization.

It should be straightforward job to slap all components of our project together and have a app to show off. Everything will
be finished soon.
