Next week I'll be making an app based on the Tamagotchi, which was a tiny plastic egg
that served as a pet-care simulator for users. Such apps now exist on mobile devices
and any would-be Javascript programmer can create one. For this project, I'll be using
the JQuery library as a requirement. The library is supposed to make things like event
handling and animation easier, which will be helpful as the app requires both to function
properly.

For example, one of the functions written updates the HTML with the current values in the
not yet written dictionary. As you can see here:

{% highlight javascript %}
 function updatePetInfoInHtml() {
  $('.name'}.text(pet_info['name']);
  $('.weight').text(pet_info['weight']);
  $('.happiness').text(pet_info['happiness']);
{% endhighlight %}

This will update a variable with the name of the Tamagotchi, the weight number, and the 
happiness number of the pet.

As this project was just issued a day ago, not much has been done with it as of this moment.
However, next week should see a completed project with a fully functional pet. As such, I will
most likely make the next blog highlighting various inner functions of the pet and how they all
work together.
