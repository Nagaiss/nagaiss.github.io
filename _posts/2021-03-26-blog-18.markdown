I finally have some direction regarding what I should be doing for our project. I was partially looking at both terraform and
ansible in anticipation on working with either one, and it turns out I'll be handling infrastructure with a terraform script that
will set up two or more AWS servers. That should be reasonable enough, but I've been handed the additional challenge of having ansible
installed on new server instances which will take a bit of wriggle work. But now I have something to aim at, so work should proceed rapidly.
I hope to have more to say on the matter in the following week.
