Continuing from last post, a few more HTML elements that are important to my current project for Comp 484 are
map, area, and time. Map and area are always used together, with area being used within a map element. Map is almost always
used as a foundation for two or more area elements, which indicate certain areas in the map image that are clickable. These
clickable elements usually link to another webpage/website. The time element on the other hand, is used to translate dates and
times into a format that machines can read and display. Time can represent a certain time on a twenty four hour clock, a specific
date in the Gregorian calendar or a time duration.

Lastly, we'll go over a few basic docker commands used in lab one. For example, docker ps -a lists all containers on your
system that exist. The command docker start (container name) will start a stopped container. docker exec -it (container name)
bash will bring up an interactive terminal.

This blog post was not very long, but hopefully next time I'll have some things about deployable image files on a docker container
to talk about. Either that or more HTML elements and attributes.
