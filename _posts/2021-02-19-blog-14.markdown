Greetings again. We're back in the new year with more blogs. I feel that we should start with the new idea for my group's
overarching project that we will be doing for the entire semester. Our idea is a self-hosted chat application which will
allow for users to have a product where they can control their own data for personal security purposes. The plan is to use
terraform, ansible and docker to deploy AWS infrastructure, configure the instance for hosting the chat server, and to
automate and deploy the chat service where it will be hosted in a container respectively.

We will have a more fleshed out presentation for our project in the coming days leading to next week. After that day comes, I'll post
more about it.
