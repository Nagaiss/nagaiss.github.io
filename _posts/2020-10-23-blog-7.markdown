Ansible is a tool that automates the configuration of one or many servers with the use of Ansible playbooks. A playbook
is an organized group of scripts that defines work for a server configuration managed by the Ansible tool. In this blog
we will briefly discuss setting up Ansible itself, then writing a playbook that installs curl. 

In this example we'll be using Ubuntu 18.04 as our OS for the docker container that we'll create. After you create your 
container, run apt update and apt install -y ansible to install Ansible in your container. After that be sure to 
make a directory to work from, like /home/ansible to keep your work in.

Now for the playbook itself, you'll want to create it something like vim. It'll look something like this:

 hosts: all
 connection: localhost
  
   tasks:
     name: Install curl
	 apt: name=curl state=present
	 
With dashes next to hosts and tasks, and line breaks after hosts, connection, tasks, name Install curl and apt name=curl state=present.
	  
After you have your playbook, install it using ansible-playbook with the file name of the playbook in angle
brackets and it should do the task for you. Next time, we may go over dockerfiles or more ansible.
