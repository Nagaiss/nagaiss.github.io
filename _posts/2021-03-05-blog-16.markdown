Our team project is rather slow going atm. I'm not sure who's supposed to be doing what, but if it comes down to it
I just might start trying to slap this thing together myself. So this blog will probably be about what exactly I'll
have to do to get started. I still have my AWS free tier account, which I'm hoping will be enough to host an instance of
one of our chat servers. I'm also going to have to find some kind of free/cheap diagram software for a proper diagram of
our server infrastructure. I'll also have to take a closer look at rocket chat as well.

I wish I had some code to share, but as of right now there's nothing. I'll definitely have to speak with Professor Smith
about what I should do.
