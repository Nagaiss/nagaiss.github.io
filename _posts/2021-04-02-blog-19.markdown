After discussing plans with the rest of the team, it's been decided that I work on setting up a terraform script to
automatically set up multiple AWS servers to host our ansible scripts and the RocketChat client itself. I've got terraform
able to set up two servers simultaneously, but now I have to have ansible installed on the servers as well, or the ansible
scripts won't work. I'll be pushing what I have to the repo shortly.
